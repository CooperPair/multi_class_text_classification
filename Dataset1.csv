I mostly only know authors who write in English. Shamefully, the only Indian queer story I know is Lihaf. So selfishly, the aim of this meet is to share queer authors and stories. The definition of queer will remain open so that the range of authors and stories is wide. All queer books and authors are welcome. You can have popular queer fiction to queer authors whose stories might not be queer. Have them international or regional. Perhaps even in another language. Queer YA? Yes, please.

But, just in case, if you have to write something that is out of your league or forte or style or area of expertise, you simply end up staring at your laptop screen or notebook. If you are a writer who has had their fair share of experience in writing and are presently finding ways to amp up your writing skills, this workshop is designed especially for you. Depending on your particular requirements and also your present level of expertise, you can gain value from this workshop while being a beginner too. If you're a poet or a research-based scholarly writer, you won't learn much here. For those two fields, Rupi Kaur and your college professor will provide better learning. The workshop will be facilitated by Arpit Chhikara. He is a freelance writer from Delhi who has travelled to various places in India by earning money using his writing skills. His work has been published at Arre, Love Matters India and Agents of Ishq. The workshop will be from 3-7 PM in the form of various writing exercises and in between, there will be a break for 30 minutes. It is requested that you stay from beginning till the end to maximise your gains. The suggested contribution is INR 300 which is to be paid at the time of registration and is non-refundable. Post the workshop, in the coming two months you'll get:- - a bi-monthly guided exercises pdf to practice and keep track of your creative journey - a bi-monthly one-to-one call opportunity with the facilitator to sort out your specific work-related queries Other than the above benefits, you'll also receive links to books, articles, podcasts and authors to follow for maintaining consistency in improving your skills. The learning during the workshop and in the successive two months is designed to last until the next year's monsoon arrives. During this learning journey, you'll find yourself:- - writing in your own voice - more spontaneous in thinking - getting rid of the inner procrastinator We are expecting you to come with your pens, notebooks (or laptop if you're more comfortable with it) and an open mind.",

Simone De Beauvoir: From Existentialism to Feminism,Literature & stories,15,"Written in 1949, The Second Sex by Simone de Beauvoir is undoubtedly one of the most theoretically and politically influential books of the last century.

Surely an assessment of Simone de Beauvoir�s life and thought in the intellectual panorama of the 20th century and its impact on the social and political ideas and movements is a worthy topic for academic consideration. A woman philosopher. This was the very essence of Simone de Beauvoir as in the act of thinking, writing and struggling as a woman she found her identity and scope in life. Her writings provide a key to understanding her life and commitment and to evaluating her legacy today, nearly 33 years after her death. This one-day conference aims to provide a better perception of Simone de Beauvoir with participants and panelists from a variety of disciplines that range from literature to gender studies, from philosophy to social sciences, offering a multidisciplinary and multi-dimensional overview of the life and works of Simone de Beauvoir.

Ek Mulaqat Manto Se,Literature & stories,15,"COLLECTIVE MADNESS in collaboration with UPSTAGE PRODUCTION presents THEATRE GARAGE PROJECT production EK MULAQAT MANTO SE. Conceived & performed by Ashwath Bhatt. Creative Producer Maneesh Verma Meet Manto as he delves into his life, childhood, family & friends, facing persecution, self-ridicule, depression, being broke, helplessness, drinking, Hindi cinema, satire, irony, hypocrisy, sadness, strife and moral decay. Saadat Hasan Manto is an Indo-Pakistani writer known for his irreverent writing, holding up a mirror to the society especially in ugly times. He is hailed as one of Urdu's finest & most controversial writers. The performance is based on articles written by Manto and explores his life, times he lived in and the social changes, he witnessed at the time of India�s Partition. Ashwath Bhatt plays Manto who engages with the audience in person, trying to answer the biggest question �Why I write what I write�. The texts used in the play are �Manto, Main Afsana Kyun Kar Likhta hoon, Khol Do, Kal Sawere Jo Meri Ankh Khuli and Deewaroon Pe Likhna. Begum Akhtar�s ghazals have been used at a few places to highlight the pathos of Manto�s life. Running successfully for last 10 years with more than 40 shows. Internationally, it�s been performed at Hakaya Festival (Amman Jordan), Luton Mela & The Hat Factory (Luton), Norden Farm Art Centre (Maidenhead, UK), Nehru Centre (London), Indian Embassy (Berlin, Germany), World Performing Arts Festival (Lahore, Pakistan). Nationally, travelled to Jammu, Srinagar, Kolkata, Siliguri, Behrampore-West Bengal, Guwahati-Assam, Gangtok-Sikkim, Delhi, Madurai, Bangalore, Amritsar, Lucknow, Bareilly, Ahmedabad, Gurgaon-Haryana & Patna-Bihar.

Presently shooting for Dharma Production�s Kesari with Akshay Kumar. He was the first recipient of prestigious Inlaks foundation scholarship for Theatre / Acting. He is a visiting faculty to various prestigious institutions in India & abroad. He has worked with reputed theatre companies like Oxfordshire theatre Company- Oxford, GYLPT- Greenwich, Flying Fish Theatre Company- Berlin etc. He has done plays for BBC worldwide and has been part of a collaboration with National Theatre, Mannheim/Germany. He has acted under the direction of various Indian and Foreign theatre luminaries and conducted workshops on various aspects of acting in England, Germany, France, Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Jordan, Nepal, Pakistan, and India. He is on the selection panel of LAMDA in India as well as �Inlaks Theatre India Awards� which is his brainchild. He is widely known for his work on 'Red Nose Clowning' theatre form in India. In 2007, he established non-profit trust � Theatre Garage Project. The philosophy behind his work is 'Finding something in nothing'. He recently directed play �Paladin' based on the best-selling book 'When Breath Becomes Air' by Dr. Paul Kalanithi. WHY MANTO Throughout his life, Manto faced a lot of criticism & persecution for his writing, his characters, his expression and choice of words. His famous response to all the criticism was �I don�t write filth, I don�t write obscenity, I only write what is there in your society!�. Manto always fought and stood for freedom of speech & expression. His stories and perspective towards the social issues are still stand relevant. We chose to perform Manto�s articles because the bigger idea is to let the audience meet the real Manto, not just a controversial & obscene writer which a normal perception of him. Manto has written a lot about India-Pakistan partition. Since then, the world has moved on, we are still stuck in the quagmire of ignorance, fear, communalism, and hate. The world would have been a much better place if we could learn from our history. Neither Pakistan nor India deserves him. If Manto, who hated didacticism, were asked if he had a message for the people of the sub-continent, he would surely say, �Lets make peace�. TESTIMONIALS ""Interesting would be an understatement to describe the play's singular method of rendition"" - Sunday Guardian ""Play salutes the literary genius of Manto."" - Asian Age ""Ashwath has an uncanny resemblance to Manto."" - Deccan Herald ""Ashwath is a remarkable, serious actor who works from within. There is never a moment of untruth in his work."" - Mira Nair ""Ashwath is more than an actor, he's a chameleon, he has shown his ability to absorb and assimilate into his character that takes the performance to another level.� - Rajan Patel, Film Maker Ashwath is an artist of high quality and sensitivity. I experience Ashwath as someone who is dedicated to make theatre work alive and truthful. Reinhard Horstkotte Artistic Director, Red Noses, Germany",

Business vs Busyness - BLR,Business,2,"Every leader, business / startup founder speaks about putting maximum hours at work, it is not about just working, it is about working smart. There are these burn out points that every founder faces with each of their potential but if the way you work is smartly designed, the burn out points actually go to boost your startup as well. Yes, we are telling you the truth. This is a tested and tried aspect of working styles by leaders. Having to make yourself busy is not the objective of being an entrepreneur. Having to make every hour of yours count 10 times more than its actual capacity is what the object of a founder must be. This session, we intend to touch on those very important aspects that a founder tends to miss out on, as they keep moving in their journey. Things as simple as Time Management, Time allocation to the various responsibilities, productivity tracker, deliverable measurement tools that can be created in a basic Google drives can go a long way. Finally, the mind-set, the biggest hurdle to over come. There is this someone in every founder�s head that tells him/ her on how not to do the things that might not be directly in relationship to the startup but the art of breaking through those thoughts and having these tools in place and using them to ensure that you do not end building a BUSYNESS and build true aggressively growing BUSINESS. A free session, so just drop by at the venue and make the best of it.",

Effective Communications for Higher Performance,Business,2,"In today’s knowledge economy, when human resource is considered as the key competitive edge that organizations can have, the ability to communicate effectively has become crucial for managerial effectiveness. Organizations understand that achieving success in today’s workplace is closely tied to the ability of employees and managers to communicate effectively not only with each other but also with people outside the organization. However, communication is effective only when the message is understood and when it stimulates action or encourages the receiver to think in new ways. With good communication skills, one can anticipate problems, make decisions, coordinate work flow, supervise others, develop relationships and increase one’s as well as organizational effectiveness. Without effective communication, ideas misfire or fail to gain attention. Research has shown that on an average, 14 percent of each 40 hours work week is wasted because of poor communication between subordinates and the superiors. In an organization, communication can be oral and interpersonal, in one to one or one to many. It can also be in the written form, as in business letters, reports, proposals etc. With proliferation and penetration of technology, electronic communication has become a norm. Whether it is giving feedback, reporting, delegating, allocation of tasks or simply sharing of information; communication skills influence group dynamics and thus, has an impact on the overall personal and organizational effectiveness.",

Women in Tech: The Future of AI,Science & Technology,22,"Women in Tech: The Future of AI Friday, November 16, 2018 11:00am - 5:00pm Banatao Auditorium, Sutardja Dai Hall, UC Berkeley Since Ada Lovelace wrote the first computer program nearly 200 years ago, women have contributed to the advancement of computing and helped pave the way for today�s artificial intelligence (AI). Today, women are pushing the frontiers of AI in applications from robotics to recruiting, from startups to venture capital. Equally far-reaching are women�s contributions to investigate AI�s social, ethical, and legal implications. For all the promise of new technology, AI can exacerbate negative effects when it reinforces biases and inequalities. Estimates show that women comprise only 13.5 percent of those working in machine learning, one of the fastest growing technology fields. This well-recognized gender gap continues to deter talent and diminish potential for the field, which will affect innumerable aspects of our economy and everyday lives. WITI@UC imagines a different future. At this year�s symposium, we will highlight the experiences of women in AI and explore our collective future with representatives from established companies, startups, academia, and the public sector. The event will also feature the WITI@UC Athena Awards recognizing those who have championed the advancement of women in technology. The symposium is open to everyone, encouraging a broader audience to join the conversation. Attendees will have the opportunity to share experiences, establish new connections, and collectively champion the advancement of women in technology.

Unpack Play,Sports & Fitness,23,"Human beings love play. Be it board games, card games, computer games, or sports, we play different kinds of games. Games are about fun and entertainment. But can games be used as tools? Tools that help us tackle wicked problems? �Wicked problems� constantly change, and adapt to any intervention. In order to meaningfully address wicked problems, we need spaces where people can collaborate, ideate, and have an informed dialogue. Games help create such spaces for informed dialogues. The non-confrontational, yet realistic environment of games creates a safe space for participants to experiment and learn from failure. Such games can be used for learning and research in areas such as transport, waste management, city planning, disaster management, energy planning, and climate change, which involve multiple stakeholders, and complex trade-offs. A good game should model the real world in just the necessary amount of detail; simplify it too much and the game loses touch with reality; complicate it with various rules, and information, and the game becomes hard to play. It involves the subtle art of balance. If this sounds interesting, we invite you join Unpack Play, the game design course at Fields of View. Whether you are a domain expert or a tool builder, the course will take you through the process of problem formulation, elements of game design, and creation of prototype. You will learn how to decide when and where a game is useful, and how to facilitate and conduct such games.",

About the team: U Mumba The most consistent team during the first three seasons, U Mumba took the tournament by storm by reaching the final three times in a row. The team did get its hands on the trophy in Season 2. And after finishing runners-up in Season 3, it looked like U Mumba would dominate the tournament for years to come. But Seasons 4 and 5 were comparatively unimpressive with the team failing to qualify beyond the group stages. Season VI is the dawn of a new era at U Mumba. With a reimagined squad which shows a brilliant mix of experience in defence and a young offensive line, the team also sees a new coaching staff taking reins. An eye on the glory days, the Mumboys will be hoping to set the stage alight with their performance during VIVO Pro Kabaddi Season VI. Gear up for VIVO Pro Kabaddi League 2018-19!

HERO Indian Super League 2018-19: Kerala Blasters FC vs Mumbai City FC,Sports & Fitness,23,"The Hero Indian Super League (ISL) is India's unrivalled football championship which kicked off on 12 October, 2014. The league has ten franchises based in the following cities: Chennai, Delhi, Goa, Guwahati, Kochi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Jamshedpur. Their aim is for India to become a global football power and qualify for the 2026 FIFA World Cup! Kerala Blasters: About the team So near yet so far. Two heartbreaking narrow final losses to ATK form the crux of their ISL history so far. The side from football mad Kochi are desperate to take that final leap that will see their name etched on the ISL trophy at last. David James staying on and signing a new contract shows the club believes in continuity and giving him time to get his plan right. This same spirit is exemplified by Sandesh Jhingan, the veteran Indian defender who has been with them from the start and provides solidity and leadership from the back. A strong Indian presence around him with the likes of Anas Edathodika, CK Vineeth and Holicharan Narzary make this an exciting, balanced squad. The tools are there, now it is time to use them to achieve results. This is the season that the Blasters fans might just have been waiting for. Can they do it? Mumbai City FC: About the team It would be fair to say that Mumbai City FC have had a disappointing first four seasons in the ISL but they are doing their absolute best to turn things around. Whilst their search for a new manager is ongoing, they have added a whole host of players to their roster, focussing particularly on the defensive side of things. Lucian Goian, their Belgian rock at the back, is the ideal mentor for these new players. With the right appointment to lead them, the backing of fans at the Mumbai Football Arena where the national team did so well recently, and a few tweaks to improve their performance in front of goal, and this is a club ready to reach the very top. The Island City is expectant, could this be the year Mumbai City FC deliver?",

Delhi Dynamos FC: About the team Delhi Dynamos is an engrossing and fascinating club. A roller coaster ride through the first 4 ISL seasons where they made the semi-finals twice, showed progress only to fail to build on it consistently. Their philosophy is sound though. Focus on young Indian talent and help them progress to the national side and develop them in the league along the way. An outspoken managing director, a raucous fan base and some interesting pre-season appointments including former Barcelona youth coach Josep Gombau as head coach this term make the club even more compelling to follow. They have identified the defensive areas that need to be strengthened after conceding the most goals last year by bringing in some steel in Bikramjit Singh and Narayan Das. After two years of progress, last season was a bit of a blow, and they will be even keener to bounce back and make their first final in this tournament! FC Pune City: About the team After 3 years of relative stagnancy, FC Pune City finally managed a semi-final spot in the 2017-17 season. A fiery, spirited club with players to match one could say that the improvement in results was coming. They have made 2 very interesting signings ahead of the new season. With 79 appearances and 28 goals, Canadian Iain Hume is the ISL all-time record holder for goals and appearances and will undoubtedly add the firepower they so badly need in front of goal. The second is Marcos Paqueta as manager, a Brazilian with over 30 years of coaching experience with success leading international sides, Brazilian club sides and Brazilian international youth setups. This is the makings of a club that intends to improve on last year�s showing and is making all the right moves so far in doing just that. Robin Singh, Keenan Almeida and Alwyn George are impressive domestic signings as well. The Orange Army waits with bated breath!",

Happy Healthy Spine - Yoga for Back Pain Relief,Health,11,"Ancient Yogis say, you are as healthy as your spine. Meru Danda as we call it in the yogic language, the spine is the axis for good health.

Happy Healthy Spine is a 3 hour workshop focussing on waking up, nourishing and de-stressing the entire back. You will learn correct postures and home workout routines tailormade to suit your body type.",
Rasaanubhava - Embodying Emotions,Health,11,"Introduction: The workshop explores the inter-dynamics of Self, Other and Universe from a blended perspective of Indian aesthetics, metaphysics, traditions of performance, martial arts and yoga, as well as methodologies from contemporary theatre and movement arts. The basic premise is that emotions and feelings are not just psychological, but psychosomatic - they do not belong to the intellect but are rooted in the body. The workshop will explore how breath, gaze, facial expression, posture, stance and gesture interact to create different internal states. The programme will be co-led by Sooraj Nambiar, one of the finest exponents in our times of Kootiyattom, the two millennia old Sanskrit dance theatre form of Kerala, and Arka Mukhopadhyay - theatre practitioner and process facilitator. Further details: At the heart of the Indian aesthetic tradition lies the rasaa framework, one of the most comprehensive and profound explorations of human emotional dynamics. Kootiyattom, the ancient Sanskrit dance theatre of Kerala, is a living embodiment of this framework, and is considered an intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO. Rarely seen outside Kerala even today, Kootiyattom is one of the world's artistic treasures and incarnates the archetypal aspects of our psyche through its gods, demons and larger than life human beings. They become living embodiments of the cardinal human emotions - the rasaas. We bring this sacred art together with contemporary processes from theatre to take you on a journey through your own emotional geography and the archetypes that dwell there: both the radiant as well as the darker, often denied aspects of ourselves. We each have inside of us a Ravana, a Krishna, a Karna, a Draupadi, a Sita, a Hector, a Macbeth. We shall look into the mirror of Self and encounter all these and more, within. Approach: We take as our starting point the fact that for each emotional state, there is a specific rhythm of breath that animates the body. So, by becoming aware of body and breath, we can become more aware of our own emotional geography, and develop the ability of 'emotional witnessing' - to witness our own inner drama with a certain aesthetic detachment. Through the basic techniques of Kootiyattom as well as contemporary embodied theatrical processes, we will experience in depth the ceaseless dance of emotions - heroism, rage, fear, hatred, amor, wonderment, joy and sorrow, and explore practical, real life applications of this understanding and how it relates to various constructs of identity, such as gender, class, etc. The workshop is open to people from all backgrounds and does not need any prior training or experience. It is of special significance to facilitators, trainers, coaches, OD consultants, counsellors, therapists, healers, school teachers, special educators, those teaching in b-schools, yoga practitioners, performing artists and others interested in navigating their inner geography and the archetypes within. Come, for an unforgettable, transformative experience.

Monthly Mindfulness at MyBoTree,Health,11,"The constant exposure to information and technology is making our minds spin faster than ever before. Our daily lives have become more and more demanding, yet our ability to manage those demands isn�t improving. We are constantly busy, but no matter how good we get at multitasking we still feel like we are missing out.

Family Constellation Workshop,Health,11,"The Greater Soul moves in only one direction, and that is to bring into union that which has been made separate. - Bert Hellinger What is a Family Constellations Workshop? Family Constellation is a therapeutic healing approach to bring about balance and flow in life. In constellation work, we look at the hidden dynamics and inherited trauma that gets passed on from generation to generation creating entanglements, being stuck and unhappiness in life, preventing us from living life fully. The work brings to light the inherited and unconscious patterns that keep us stuck and when these entanglements are revealed, we are able to step into the possibilities of new movements of the soul which are healthy and life affirming. The work unfolds in a safe and gently held group guided and supported by the facilitators. Who can participate? If you feel stuck in any area of your life- relationships, family, work, health; if there are familiar behaviours or repetitive patterns or events that seem to keep recurring- family constellations offers an approach that goes deep below the surface to bring about agreement and balance. We look at illness, anxiety, depression, addictions, relationship problems, financial issues from a systemic lens 18+ and above can participate. About the Facilitators: Sridevi Padmanabhan: Sridevi is a circle facilitator and trained practitioner of Family Constellations. Having trained under Annie Cariappa (Spanda) and Colette Green (Ochre, Ireland) for over two years, she is informed by her years of personal work, energy work, meditation and somatic approaches.

Aakanksha Singh: Aakanksha is a circle facilitator, flow host, and a practitioner of Family Constellations.

Introduction to Sound Healing Everyone has a vibration that represents the signature of their health and wellbeing. Similar to a musical instrument that can fall out of tune due to prolonged use, on account of thoughts, emotions, feelings and stress, our bodies can also fall out of vibrational harmony and potentially develop illnesses not only physically but also experience financial obstacles as well. Quantum Physics has proven that everything has vibration whether it�s a table, a chair, a person, a planet, or a cosmos. And wherever there is sound, there is vibration. When we use sound coupled with intentions (using Tibetan singing bowls, gongs, tuning forks, frequency music, mantras etc.), we can direct sound vibration to raise the body�s vibrational frequency opening up the flow of energy to orient towards vibrational alignment with health as well as financial prosperity shifting the lower frequencies to higher and hence leading to miraculous healing of physical, mental as well as emotional problems. After 45 minutes of Sound healing session using Tibetan Singing bowls, one can feel as if stress is free from every cell, mind is relaxed and body is highly rejuvenated. People have shared great relief from problems like back pain, joint pains, allergies, migraine, insomnia, depression etc. Watch video about Sound Healing:",

Past Life Regression Therapist Training,Health,11,"About The Event Welcome to a life changing training to become a therapist and heal people from their karmic traps and enhance lives. We are proud to announce The Therapist Training Program from Dec 1st to 7th 2018 in the serene valley of Rishikesh. Purpose When we relive we are relieved Our soul or atman is multidimensional. Every dimension holds within it a facet of our collective consciousness. Through the tool of past life therapy, you can touch the myriad kaleidoscopic self and create insight into the various questions that may be troubling your existence today. The past lies in the present while the present holds a key to the future. It is in the present we can visit the past and free ourselves from the beliefs, emotions and thoughts that may be blocking our enlivenment of our souls to take us to a brighter, happier and joyous self. The purpose to teach past life therapy is to help all of us who want to heal ourselves and others take a quantum leap towards healing the psychic wounds that create a repetitive recurrent pattern of toxic thoughts and beliefs. These then grow into tumors of turmoil sucking the person into a quagmire of questions. Why me and what have I done??? A journey into your past life develops insight into your present actions. It helps to take you to your unknown frontiers of consciousness and unravel the purpose of your earthly existence. It also gives you an understanding that there are so many other existences that you have lived before each one more fascinating than the other. With its benefit seen in my clients, I feel happy to share my insights and experience in making the world free of guilt and fear. Many of us don�t even know that we can hold the torch of free will to reach the spirit of enlivenment that lives within all of us. We are co-creators in the path towards enlivenment.

Taught by leading UK and US yoga therapists, our course complies with UK standards for Yoga Therapy and is accredited by the British Council of Yoga Therapy (BCYT). It meets the National Occupational Standards (NOS) for yoga therapy upheld by the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC)...With a practical grounding in key yoga therapy skills, as well as a synthesis of yoga therapy approaches from different traditions, the training provides a balance of theory and practical work. We view individuals holistically: our therapists are taught to adapt yoga practices and techniques and apply them to the needs of each individual, rather offering than prescriptive practices for particular conditions. Yoga is for everybody but every body is unique...We have a core faculty of widely respected teachers and yoga therapists, supplemented by experts in relevant fields to bring their differing perspectives to the course...Our 22-month, 550-plus hours course will include teachings on:..•	What yoga philosophy can tell us about health, healing and the relief of suffering.•	Less widely known practices particularly suitable for use in yoga therapy, including yoga nidra, restorative yoga, pawanmuktasana.•	How to use asana, pranayama and meditation practices in yoga therapy.•	Building the therapeutic relationship: communication and listening skills.•	Case history taking and client assessment.•	The body as an energetic system and its impact on internal disorders.•	Common medical conditions, including a focus on yoga for cancer and insomnia.•	Pain and its management and psychological issues around pain.•	Yoga Therapy for mental health and trauma.•	Yoga approaches to structural therapy and yoga for back care.•	Practical training in working with clients..Yogacampus recognise that yoga therapy is a new, emerging discipline, not a long-established cut-and-dried subject. We therefore encourage debate and diversity among teachers and students and take a non-dogmatic approach to our teaching. As well as theory, the course is rooted in the development of practical skills. We are proud to have set up the first Yoga Therapy Student Clinic at The Life Centre in Islington, London. Here, students have a unique opportunity not available on other training courses: to gain over 60 hours of practical experience with real clients, under the supervision of leading yoga therapists...We believe effective communication and learning requires instantaneous and responsive multi-platforms provided by e-Learning and digital technology. In 2018 we will offer students the benefit of a unique blended learning experience through a university-style integrated learning platform, together with face to face interaction. This virtual learning environment affords greater freedom and flexibility for both teacher and student.

We forget that polluting less is still pollution.� Does your idea change the way waste is managed while earning you cash? Agri Business Agribusiness is the business of agricultural production. It includes agrichemicals, breeding, crop production (farming and contract farming), distribution, farm machinery, processing, and seed supply, as well as marketing and retail sales.

Bohris normally eat their food on a big plate (called a thaal), seated on the floor. But realizing that non bohris are not always comfortable doing that -- we've modified this, where guests sit on chairs / our sofa and can use our state-of-the-art shiny cutlery; but we still serve the food on a thaal placed on a table. 2. We do not have a lift - you have to climb 2 flights of beautiful wooden stairs! 3. We love kids! So much so, that in the rare instance where we run out of food, we even offer to marinate the little munchkins and offer them on the Thaal! (Kids under 12 are charged at 50%) 4. We as of yet, do not have air conditioning (working on it). But we have two fake dell air-coolers. 5. #NoSerialKillerPolicy� - Unfortunately since we host people at our residence, we are sticklers about who we invite. It helps a lot if we have mutual friends or if you are the prime minister of a country. Call our samosa helpline at 9819-447-438 for more details. 6. Cancellation Policy - Cancel before dad gets the ingredients (72 hours before the event and we refund 100%), after that we keep the advance payment (50%) or if its possible, we can try and transfer your booking to another date.",

Ek Ant Ki Shuruaat,Stage shows,33,"Aamhi theatre - ""EK ANT KI SHURUAAT"" ( 2 one act plays of 55 min each) Rashtra (HINDI) Original story by renowned Marathi writer Shri. C.P. Deshpande Concept of the play- Sandeep Paranjape Hindi translation by Shri. Deevas Gupta Politics is a game without a methodical win or a careful loss, where a win or a loss is always momentary. A timeless tale of a democratic setup conveyed using storytelling style, which will surprise, every common man, with the twists and turns of the story as it unfolds. A story, where A male political party & a female political party in a power struggle, where voters are eunuchs, where one may not be aware of what is going to unveil in front of you. Politics is a never-ending game, where scapegoats are always the voters. This play tries to describe the most elementary thought behind the smallest to the biggest political games, strive for an eternal win. Whatever we all think, see, listen or speak, can lead us to the dirtiest game plans ever designed & still win is never-lasting. Any change of power is always an end of old story & beginning of a new story. Swami (HINDI) Original story by renowned Marathi writer Shri. G.A.KULKARNI Concept of the play- Sandeep Paranjape Hindi translation by Shri. Deevas Gupta According to a Chinese proverb, the destiny of a traveler is greater than that of a king, for he knows not what lay ahead of him. Reaching the destination could be an answer that he sought or a question that he gained or a complete new life. His destination was far beyond the reaches of any ambition he had at the commencement & what reveals in front of him is so shocking, yet so pure, so true, so rationalized. Still wishes never die, as a person puts on new garments, giving up the old ones, the soul accepts new material bodies, giving up the old & useless ones. Swami is a tale of a traveler & his journey through the beyond belief to a self transformation.",

Accidental Death of An Anarchist,Stage shows,33,"Accidental Death of an Anarchist, a play by Italian playwright Dario Fo, is based loosely on real-life events involving the Italian rail worker and anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli, who died under mysterious circumstances while in police custody in 1969.

The events that led to Pinelli�s death have never been revealed, and Fo�s intention is to depict a fictionalized version of the aftermath, through the actions of a scheming con man known only as the Maniac.

The play is brilliantly blended satire and farce with a fast-moving plot that features many surprises every time. The plot of play also concerns the classic conflict between love and money. Kanji Mehta, the miser (makhichoos) is an old man and is obsessed with the wealth he has amassed and always ready to save expenses. He wishes to marry a young girl; while his son (Jignesh) wants to marry the same girl. There are a lot of Hilarious and comic fights between son and father for the same girl. While, he suggests his son marries an old woman, who could take care and also suggested his daughter marries an old man to save the dowry. A classical fight and loaded with hilarious moments, the miser entertains the audience thoroughly every time.",

Achieving Oneness with the Higher Soul,Religion & Spirituality,21,"Duration: 2 days.Eligibility: None..Discover the essence of enlightenment!!.Ancient meditations, kept secret for centuries, will be revealed and taught to the public for the first time. These techniques allow you to accelerate the union of your incarnated soul (often described as the personality or lower self) with your Higher Soul (Higher Self)...The course also teaches us the true nature of ourselves, our Higher Soul and the divinity within us, and how to unite with them. Many esoteric secrets are revealed for the first time in this course. This phenomenon is known as “Soul-Realization”, “Enlightenment” or “Self-Realization”...There are different stages of soul realization. The first stage in soul realization involves the intellectual understanding that you are the soul, a spiritual being of divine intelligence, love and power. You are not the physical body, not the thoughts nor the emotions and not even the mind. The thoughts and emotions are products of the soul, just as the carpenter is not the furniture. The mind is just a subtle instrument of the soul, just as the computer is your instrument...The second stage is experiencing one’s self as the soul during meditation. The yogi or the meditator may experience not being able to feel the physical body, as though it has disappeared...The spiritual practitioner may have an out-of-body experience, the soul occupying and manifesting in other subtle bodies of light and being able to travel at a speed faster than the speed of light...With further development, the yogi may have an experiential realization of the nature of the soul. The nature of the soul is basically that of a being of light. A yogi experiences himself as a being of light travelling in all directions throughout the physical and the inner universe...The third stage in soul realization is the experience of the incarnated soul (that is you) having union with the higher soul and realizing that there is no separation between you and your higher soul. The incarnated soul and higher soul are actually one. The yogi also experiences oneness with other souls, not just human souls, but all other types of souls. At this levels, the process of arhatship starts...In this course one might experience oneness with the divine spark or the Paramatma. This is called God-Realization. The incarnated and higher souls experience oneness with the Divine Spark, oneness with God, oneness with all. The yogi can literally say, ”I and my Father are one!” He is truly a Divine Incarnate...Some of the Benefits you will get are:..Experiencing Peace, Calmness and Clarity in the midst of a busy and chaotic work/home environment..Releasing old emotional baggage and creating positive changes in all your relationships..Using Words of Power (mantras) to quickly achieve Inner Stillness..Experiencing ""Coming Home and Being One with All""..Experiencing the unique state of Total Peace and Expansion of Consciousness and Awareness within minutes of meditation..You will also:..Discover the Nature of Your Soul and its journey through timeless incarnations..Learn how your Soul chooses your parents and place of birth..Know the exact location of the 12th Chakra and its function..Experience the Inner Light and Intense Bliss of the ""Blue Pearl"" or the ""Seed of Consciousness"" within you..Learn the existence of energetic seeds in your auric field and how they affect your Spiritual, Mental, Emotional and Physical lives. These ""energetic DNA recorders"" contain the ""blueprints"" for the formation of your subtle and physical bodies..Increase the size of the ""communication cable"" between your Higher Soul and incarnated soul. This is seen in religious pictures as a shaft of light coming down to an illuminated halo. It is also depicted as the ""Descent of the Holy Spirit"" in Christian terminology.

ABOUT WOMENS CIRCLE From ancient times, women around the world have come together and sat in circles, engaged in rituals, used the power of their intention and intuition to guide their lives as well as the lives of their family and community, and together have held the social fabric of culture. The power of the circle is grounding, holds women in connection to one another, and supports the synchronization of the rhythm of their bodies with each other, with the earth and nature. It also builds a healthy supportive community. More About Circle Facilitation: http://www.shestandstall.com/circle-centered-facilitation.html SIGNIFICANCE OF NEW MOON New Moon Marks the beginning of a new moon cycle - a fresh beginning in its full cycle of waning and waxing. It is the time to let go of the old, and plant new seeds of intentions for what you wish to bring forth in your life in all aspects! When we share sacred space together, we exponentially magnify the power of our intentions and energetically create a web of support for each other. More on women spirituality can be found here: http://www.shestandstall.com/women-s-wisdom.html WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS? Benefits of Being in a Women's Circle: Women participating in the Sisterhood Project experience increased confidence and self-esteem, expanded awareness of themselves and their surroundings, rootedness in their bodies and sexuality, and a deep sense of connection with the Earth, Nature and Life around. Even more importantly, there is a sense of being seen, acknowledged, listened to and understood. WHAT WILL HAPPEN Each New Moon Circle will have a theme. There will be an intentional opening of the circle through an invocation ritual facilitated by the founder of She Stands Tall Project followed by a group engagement through a meditation or guided imagery connected to the theme of the day. Then we will engage in a simple creative expression modality of intention making using any one of the tools like journaling, visual art, improv, poetry, collaging, etc. We will close with reflection and sharing.

"Beyond The Body by Angela: Spirituality, Awakening & Spiritual Growth",Religion & Spirituality,21,"A session with Tarot reader and Reiki instructor Angela Radhakrishnan. ""Are you just the physical body, or does consciousness exist beyond the physical realm? Do time and distance really exist? What exactly is Sixth Sense? Are some born with it, or can it be developed? Who am I? Why am I here? What is my purpose here?Is this a cosmic joke, or is there more to what meets the eye? Why this cycle of birth and death? Why is there negativity, crime, and poverty around? Why can't everyone be good?! Do Past-Lives exist? These are a few questions that will be answered in this session. Sixth Sense or Extra Sensory Perception such as telepathy, clairvoyance, intuition, clairaudience, clairsentience, clair-cognition is a natural ability that everyone is born with. This has nothing to do with their spiritual growth. These are senses that go beyond the physical body. We really are made up of 8 bodies of Light or energy. In this session, you will be taught, seeing, feeling and sensing the aura of self and others, and if we get time, the effect of our thoughts and emotions in water and objects on our auric body. I would also talk about who we really are, why we are here, and what is it your Guardian Angels and Spirit Guides want you to know. I would be using various means of divination, such as Oracle Cards, Psychometry, Channeling, Psychic Reading, as well as Crystal Ball Gazing. Finally, we will end with an intense meditation, for you to experience the Divine You ..."" � Reiki Healer Angela Radhakrishnan",

Mustang Spiritual Tour,Religion & Spirituality,21,"Muktinath is a sacred place for both Hindus and Buddhists located in Muktinath Valley at an altitude of 3,710 meters at the foot of the Thorong La mountain pass (part of the Himalayas) in Mustang, Nepal. The site is close to the village of Ranipauwa, which is sometimes mistakenly called Muktinath. Within Hinduism, it is called Mukti Kshetra, which literally means the ""place of liberation or moksh"". This temple is considered to be 106th among the available 108 Divya Desam (premium temples) considered sacred by the Sri Vaishnava sect. The ancient name of this place in Sri Vaishnava literature, before Buddhist origin[clarification needed], is Thiru Saligramam. This[clarification needed] houses the Saligram shila, considered to be the naturally available form of Sriman Narayan � the Hindu Godhead. It is also one of the 108 Siddhpeeth & is named Mahadevi[Devibhagwat 7.14]. The Buddhists call it Chumig Gyatsa, which in Tibetan means ""Hundred Waters"". Although the temple has a Vaishnav origin, it is also revered in Buddhism because guru padmasambhava meditated there for some time. For Tibetan Buddhists, Muktinath is a very important place of dakinis, goddesses known as Sky Dancers, and one of the 24 Tantric places. They understand the murti to be a manifestation of Avalokite?vara, who embodies the compassion of all Buddhas.",

"If animals can perceive spiritual vibrations, why can�t humans? - 23 Oct 2018",Religion & Spirituality,21,"The Spiritual Science Research Foundation invites you to attend a unique spiritual lecture. All are welcome. A massive tsunami hit Sri Lanka in 2004 that led to over 100,000 casualties. Curiously, there were almost no animal deaths reported, even though many animals lived in the area. It seemed that most animals had left before the tsunami struck. Incidents like this have been reported throughout history, and so far, science has been unable to provide answers. The Spiritual Science Research Foundation in association with the Maharshi University of Spirituality has been conducting unique spiritual research for the past 30 years. Events like the one described above inspired us to study the effects of the spiritual dimension on animals. We found that animals do get influenced by spiritually positive and negative stimuli in the environment and react to them. In this lecture, we will show you videos that demonstrate how spiritual positivity and negativity affect different kinds of animals and explain the reasons behind it. We also touch upon why humans have lost this ability to sense the spiritual dimension and how we can take steps to reverse this trend and increase spiritual positivity in the environment. This is a free event. You can donate as per what you feel you have gained from the lecture. If you have any questions or would like to contact us, please email us at ssrffareast@gmail.com or call +60 12-274 2046. Presenters of the workshop His Holiness Cyriaque Vallee is originally from France. He was a successful fashion model and used to travel the world modelling for internationally recognised brands such as Giorgio Armani and Ermenegildo Zegna. When he was introduced to Spirituality by his wife (who was also a successful model), he realised that only spiritual practice can give everlasting happiness. In January 2009, they made the decision to come and stay at the Spiritual Research Centre and Ashram in Goa, India and dedicate themselves to spiritual practice. They moved to India with only 3 suitcases of belongings and they have been living in the Spiritual Research Centre and Ashram for the past 10 years. By doing spiritual practice with full dedication, he made rapid spiritual progress and reached Sainthood in 2013. Cyriaque oversees all of SSRF�s activities internationally and hundreds of seekers have received invaluable guidance and support from him in their spiritual journeys. Vincent Malherbe is from Belgium and is of Catholic background. Vincent holds a Master in Finance from the Vlerick Business School in Belgium. He started his career in Singapore in 2003 and co-founded a physical gold trading business that he still manages today. His active work and social lives were accompanied by destructive habits such as excessive drinking and smoking. After discovering the SSRF website, Vincent started chanting and implemented spiritual healing remedies which led him to completely stop drinking and smoking within a few weeks. After attending the MAV workshop at the Ashram in Goa, Vincent started regular spiritual practice and felt spiritual emotion for His Holiness Dr Athavale. Spiritual practice resulted in better health, improved relationships at home and in the office and a reduction in overall stress levels. Ms. Yi Wei Lee was born in Penang, Malaysia in a Buddhist family. Growing up in metropolitan Singapore, she had a desire to understand the true purpose of life. By profession, she was a government employee and worked as a music teacher at a primary school for a few years. She learnt about SSRF at the end of 2014, and started attending the online spiritual meetings and doing service to the absolute truth of Chinese translation for the SSRF website. Since starting spiritual practice, she�s benefitted greatly and seen many changes in her interpersonal relationships with family, friends and colleagues due to the personality defect removal process. In 2015, she had the opportunity to visit the SSRF Spiritual Research Center and Ashram in Goa, where she attended the 5-day MAV workshop. It was during that time that she had many life changing experiences. These experiences and her love for God gave her the conviction and faith to do more regular spiritual practice. Now she stays in the Ashram in Goa and is doing full time spiritual practice. This event is organized by: The Spiritual Science Research Foundationwww.ssrf.org",

Program 2:00-4:00 PM | Spiritual techniques to manage your stress and anger 4:00-4:30 PM | Break 4:30-6:00 PM | 7 Powerful self healing techniques Spiritual techniques to manage your stress and anger Everyone wants to experience more happiness in life and to truly achieve this we need to go deeper within ourselves. How we react or respond to situations depends on the impressions within our subconscious mind. In this interactive lecture we will guide you on how to identify which impressions or personality defects are causing you stress or reactions such as anger and share with you an effective spiritual technique that will help you overcome them. This technique called The Personality Defect Removal Process has been developed by His Holiness Dr. Athavale, the inspiration for SSRF and the founder of the Maharshi University of Spirituality. In His earlier professional life, He was a Clinical Hypnotherapist with a strong research background in the field and has achieved international recognition. He was the author of many journals and peer reviewed articles on the subject of Personality Development and Clinical Hypnotherapy. By combining aspects from both His background in psychiatry and from His vast knowledge of Spirituality, this technique has helped thousands of people to overcome the blocks in their lives preventing them from experiencing their true joyous nature. It has helped them to overcome debilitating personality defects such as fear, anger and insecurity allowing them to experience transformational change in their character for the better and this way improving their lives. 7 Powerful self healing techniques Have you ever experienced problems in life that do not go away despite trying all known solutions and remedies? When such problems do not go away, there is a high chance that these problems have their root cause in the spiritual dimension. If the root cause of the problem is spiritual, then only a spiritual solution will give permanent relief. Through this interactive lecture, we will help you to understand how the spiritual dimension affects every facet of our lives and how doing regular spiritual practice complimented with self-healing techniques will help you overcome many of the problems you are experiencing. Whether the problems are related to physical or mental health, many of them can be alleviated by spiritual healing methods and spiritual practice. With practical demonstrations, videos, and real-life case studies, we will guide you on how to implement 7 powerful spiritual self-healing techniques. These techniques are inexpensive and easy to apply to compliment your current spiritual practice. SSRF encourages self-healing techniques as this enables one to be independent and self-sufficient rather than dependent on others. We welcome you to join us in this spiritual lecture.

This module will bring you to greater depths delving into the revelation of His Word. We need to grow in Christ and know Him more intimately and experience Him. Life is about lifetime learning and growth, transformation and sanctification which are all a process unto eternity.

This module is a practical module where we will practise hearing the Voice of God, look into an open heaven for a supernatural vision and to pray towards its fulfilment. Objective of this module is to help you to put fire burning on the altar of your heart. We are commissioned also to go and put the live coals of fire onto other people�s lives. Let us not neglect this Commission. I assure you that this will be the Course of a lifetime where you will attain greater insights and revelations into the nature and presence of God to invite you for a cup of coffee with our Lord Jesus Christ who will reveal great things about your life, those of others and how you should ascend. At the end of the course you will be able to operate the way Jesus operates with an excellent spirit.

So what is Tai Seng? Sun Ng Hung ( S?n W�k?ng) is the Monkey King of the famous Ming Dynasty (1368 � 1644 CE) novel Journey to the West .The story is one of the Four Great Classical Novels of China and is certainly the most well known outside the country. After being born from a stone on a mountain peak, through his wit and bravery the Stone Monkey became the Handsome Monkey King of the Mountain of Flowers and Fruit. He then studied with a famed immortal and became powerful on the earth, taking the name S?n W�k?ng. He then went to Hell and wiped his name and those of his fellow monkeys, from the Book of Life and Death, thereby making himself immune to death. He was also known as the Or Bin (Black Face) Dasheng here. In order to subdue the impetuous monkey, the Jade Emperor gave him a lowly position in heaven. S?n W�k?ng rebelled and called himself Great Sage, Equal of Heaven Q�ti?n D�sh�ng, a title that heaven was forced to accept. He rebelled again after being snubbed and ate all of X? W�ng M?�s Heavens Peaches of Immortality and L?oz?�s Pills of Longevity. Through a combined force of Buddhists, Taoists and gods, the Monkey King was captured and put in L?oz?�s B?gu� Crucible container to be made into an elixir and retrieve the pills. After 49 days he burst out alive with the new power of golden-gaze fiery-eyes that enabled him to recognise evil in any form, but also left him sensitive to smoke. The gods finally appealed to Buddha, who imprisoned S?n W�k?ng under a mountain for five hundred years until his services were required to help a monk Xu�nz�ng retrieve Buddhist sutras from India. With the help of Pigsy , a pig monster and Sandy , a sand demon, they brought back the teachings and encountered many adventures and trials. Upon their return, S?n W�k?ng was granted Buddhahood and called Victorious Fighting Buddha D�u Zh�nsh�ng F�. Who is Hanuman ? As per Surya Sanhita, Lord Hanuman was born on a Saturday. Lord Hanuman is the Rudra avatar and Rudra is another name of Lord Shiva. In Hanuman shastranaam, one name of hanuman is of Shani Dev. In the Hindu faith, Hanuman was not afflicted by Shani. There is also a belief that all the planets are under the control of Hanuman's tail. Whoever worships Hanuman is granted fortitude and strength. Hanuman had the rare blessings from Shani Dev. Raavan has got a boon to become almost immortal. Raavan had won all the Nine Planets also. He put these Nine Planets as a stair case to climb up on them daily to his throne. He felt a specific joy when he climbed on to his throne stepping on their back. Hanuman is said to have rescued Shani from the clutches of Raavan. In gratitude, Shani promised Hanuman that those who would pray to him on Saturday would be rescued from the painful effects of Shani. Shani explained that ""first I will come upon your head and this will make you leave your home, wife and sons and go about suffering. Hanuman said that Shani can definitely come upon his head and as he has no family he will not suffer much with regard to his family and since his abode is at the feet of Lord Ram, he was assured that he would be able to tolerate that suffering also. So Shani took refuge on Hanuman's head. In the process Hanuman had to carry heavy boulders, trees and rocks on his head. He crushed huge rocks with his head. Shani was getting hurt and suffering in the process. Shani Dev started bleeding. Finally, Shani got away from Hanuman's head and said that you are the only one who will have no effect of my inauspiciousness. I cannot trouble you. Since you have saved me from Raavan's Pr*son I would like to give you a boon. As the boon, Hanuman asked Lord Shani not to trouble or cast evil eye on his devotees. Lord Shani promised not to trouble or cause hardships to Hanuman devotees. Lord Hanuman is believed to have got Ashta-Siddhi (Eight divine powers) and Nav-Nidhi (9 more powers).In hanuman chalisa the siddhi word means that person has attained such qualities by establishing himself into perfect self .In Hinduism, eight siddhis (Ashta Siddhi) or Eight great perfections (mahasiddhi) are described as follows : 1) ????? A?im?: reducing one�s body even to the size of an atom 2) ????? Mahima: expanding one�s body to an infinitely large size 3) ????? Garima: becoming infinitely heavy 4) ????? Laghima: becoming almost weightless 5) ?????????? Pr?pti: having unrestricted access to all place 6) ?????????? Pr?k?mya: realizing whatever one desires 7) ?????

Terbuka untuk semua Tsunami besar menghantam Sri Lanka pada tahun 2004 memakan korban 100.000 jiwa. Anehnya, hampir tidak ada kematian hewan yang dilaporkan, meskipun banyak hewan yang tinggal di daerah tersebut. Tampaknya sebagian besar hewan telah pergi sebelum tsunami melanda. Insiden seperti ini telah terjadi sepanjang sejarah, dan sejauh ini sains modern tidak mampu memberikan penjelasan. Spiritual Science Research Foundation bekerjasama dengan Universitas Spiritualitas Maharshi telah melakukan penelitian spiritual unik selama 30 tahun terakhir. Peristiwa seperti yang telah dijelaskan di atas menginspirasi kami untuk mempelajari efek dari dimensi spiritual pada hewan. Kami menemukan bahwa hewan dipengaruhi oleh stimulus spiritual positif maupun negatif di lingkungan dan bereaksi terhadapnya. Dalam seminar ini, kami akan menunjukkan video yang mendemonstrasikan bagaimana positivitas dan negativitas spiritual mempengaruhi berbagai jenis hewan dan menjelaskan alasan dibalik itu. Kami juga membahas tentang mengapa manusia telah kehilangan kemampuan untuk merasakan dimensi spiritual dan bagaimana kita dapat mengambil langkah untuk mengubahnya serta meningkatkan positivitas spiritual di lingkungan.

A Session on Relationship with Dr. Mehtab Khanam,Love & Relationships,16,"No marriage is perfect, but some get into situations that are unbearable for both or at least one, resulting in divorce, separation or constant bitterness. Divorce has become such a common phenomenon that according to a recent report by a Daily newspaper, on average one divorce takes place each hour in Dhaka with similar situation in other parts of the country. However there is more than what the numbers tell. A major portion of the couples who have been through divorce or separation or some trauma suffer severe mental depression. Some face social stigma and economic hardship. Especially with kids, traumatic relationships can get harder to manage as it impacts the mental state of the children as well. So it is high-time we focus on managing our relationships and our mental state.

Getting The Love You Want Couples Workshop,Love & Relationships,16,"The Imago GETTING THE LOVE YOU WANT Couples Workshop runs over weekends. Kobus van der Merwe has presented this weekend breakaway for more than 20 years with couples reporting that this intensive workshop translates to several months� worth of weekly couples� sessions. Highly detailed and extensively researched, the workshop is filled with the theoretical and practical elements of relationships and provides couples with enough opportunity to practice and integrate the theory into their lives. In the workshop, you will learn the real source of your power struggle. Sure, you might have already tried to change your relationship, but odds are you only worked with the symptoms. This is often why your efforts never really worked or even lasted that long. With Imago, we provide you with the skills needed to help you get to the roots of your power struggle. When you change that, then real, lasting change will happen. Marriage is about being loved and loving another person. The Imago workshop will help you work through the realities of the current tension and pain in your marriage AND move beyond the power struggle. It is about learning how to love one another in a conscious, intentional, and passionate way. The workshop will enable you to rediscover the rhythm of your relationship. While there will always be times in your marriage when there is tension or pain, it is not about avoiding it but to work through it effectively and quickly. The art of repair is integral to healthy relationships. What happens in a couples� workshop? You will get a new perspective on each other. In the power struggle, couples see each other as enemies where they lose their true identities. In this workshop, you will learn how to become allies and true to yourselves. You will learn how your marriage is a recourse for repair and growth; You will learn how to engage in dialogue. Couples need more than good communication. Sometimes communication takes you towards a power struggle and just succeed in creating more distance. In the workshop, you will learn to talk about the good as well as the frustrations in the relationship in such a way that you can repair the connection and safety you have with one another. You will also learn to commit to the relationship and to help each other growth full of expression of aliveness. This will lead to more passion and a deeper love for each other; and You will develop a deep empathy for each other's story. You will discover that your partner is not trying to harm you by being avoiding or intrusive. Instead, they are just trying to protect themselves against more pain. This empathy will create a new condition where your marriage becomes a place of healing. The power struggle will continue for as long as there is pain. Once the pain heals, the power struggle will dissolve. What you can expect from participating in the GETTING THE LOVE YOU WANT workshop: Learn how to provide greater compassion for your partner (this is something that happens to everyone); Discover new skills to break destructive cycles of communication. Couples learn how to redirect negative energy from arguments towards creating passion and stability in an enhanced relationship; Understand that the unconscious forces that attract you to your partner are also the source of conflict. Participants receive more information about themselves and their partner, organised in a new, more thoughtful way; Equip yourself with the tools needed to re-romanticise your relationship and awaken the passion that you had for one another in the past; Help each other to accept and conclude childhood issues that could be obstacles to growing your relationship; and Learn how to use your relationship for emotional healing and spiritual evolution. The Imago two-day GETTING THE LOVE YOU WANT workshop is the perfect life and relationship-enriching experience. It will teach you invaluable life skills that will not only enhance your relationship with your partner and family, but will improve and enrich the relationships with your broader circle of friends and colleagues.",

The intended learning outcomes of this open training module are: - an embodied experience of the trans-generational and systemic influences in the couple relationship through constellations. - tools for working within one�s own relationships and within professional relationship therapy and coaching. - an understanding of systemic dynamics impacting couple relationships such as: - an equal balance of giving and taking - falling in love, marriage, children or no children, separation - the position we hold towards the partner�s parents - what men and women do to support or entangle relationships - the influence of previous partners and marriages - what is priority for the couple and each system involved systemic origins of conflict - bonding and developing intimacy while still remaining free to develop and evolve - when the one partner is bonded elsewhere or not fully present roles that partners play that entangle love - separating in a way that supports the children and/or the next relationship - possible systemic repercussions for the children of unresolved couple dynamics and break-ups Individuals: R2800 Couple in a relationship: Reduced price now R4500 Please bring lunch to share.

Ta Dhom Project,Dance,27,"bFLAT Indiranagar is delighted to present the Ta Dhom Project - a path-breaking musical/cultural fusion venture fronted by Mumbai- based, ace percussionist, musician and composer, Viveick Rajagopalan. The syllables/sounds �Ta� and �Dhom� symbolize the idea of two worlds, two ideas, and two cultures. Classical Music and Hip Hop are representative of this very concept of �THE TWO WORLDS� - and yet, harmony lies hidden within their duality. Ta Dhom Project has created a sub-text in the Hip Hop Culture and added an Indian twist to it. This eclectic line-up features Mridangam and Kanjira, setting the grooves/beats - with musical layers created on the software program called Ableton Live, accompanied by the Violin, Bass Guitar and 3 immensely talented MC's who will present their Konnakol and Rap vocal skills. The art form called �Konnakol� is a very unique vocal language of percussion, derived from the sounds of an ancient percussion instrument called Mridangam, which hails from the southern states of India. Konnakol, as a vocal percussion, brings emotion to rhythm and thus shares its lineage with languages. An experiment ensued: of taking Rap (the vocal language of the American Hip Hop culture) and Konnakol, beyond their respective boundaries.

Finally, if you are a professional Dancer yourself then you are invited to join us in our scholarship program � we have opportunities for both International and Indian students. WorkShops Contact Improvisation - Freeing your capacity for expression �All are welcome to a meditative journey where presence meets creativity. Together we will awake openness, receptivity and softness in the body in movement. Free our capacity of expression, meet ourselves and meet others in a state of Presence and Empathy. We will explore Contact Improvisation through anatomical investigations and partnering exercises enhancing a state of released and effortless motion. How to access intuition and trust to enable non Verbal Communication and the capacity of Listening through Touch. Entering into a deep connection to our own structure and its intelligence, together with being, sensing, creating and transforming in intuitive dance dialogues, traveling on a subtle line where receptivity and intention meet. We will awake and integrate the Voice in our dances, tuning, harmonizing and awakening our Voice-Body Instrument. In a choral structure creating harmonies and melodies; touching stillness or movement, listening, connecting to the power of our resonating bodies and inner realities. Presence Joy and Spontaneity will be our guides!� Irene Sposetti Biodanza - Dance of Life - Finding intimacy with yourself and others through dance Although the typical experience of one participating in a biodanza class is that of playfulness, connection, intimacy, dance and joy, the fully vastness of the theoretical model behind biodanza is unlikely (or necessary) to be grasped. The system is more one of experience and its effects are present regardless of the cognitive understanding of what is occurring. However, it is fascinating to realize what is all taken into account within the system, from the neurological, physiological and psychological perspectives, to the mythological archetypes, studies of human movement and musical effects to art, transcendental states and social action. Biodanza stimulates our genetic potential through various lines of development into its highest expression. 5 Rhythms Workshops - A dynamic movement practice of being in your body 5 Rhythms is a dynamic movement practice�a practice of being in your body�that ignites creativity, connection, and community. While a seemingly simple process, the 5 Rhythms practice facilitates deep and unending explorations, moving the dancer beyond self-imposed limitations and isolation into new depths of creativity and connection. Each rhythm � Flowing Staccato Chaos Lyrical Stillness� � is interpreted by individuals in a uniquely personal way, opening them to a new sense of freedom and possibility that is both surprising and healing, exhilarating as well as deeply restorative. It is, in essence, �exercise for the right brain�. When we practice 5 Rhythms, we learn to creatively express aggressiveness and vulnerability, emotions and anxieties, edges and ecstasies. It reconnects us to cycles of birth & death and hooks us into humanity and the spirit of all living things. Within the group context, we create connection and community and hone our instincts and our intuitions. We are made up of all walks of life � every culture, religion, race, gender, age and sexual preference are welcome. 5 Rhythms transcend dance. The movement is the medicine, the meditation and the metaphor. Together we peel back layers, lay masks down, and dance till we disappear. Only to rediscover ourselves through it all. Creative Movement Therapy - Explore your unique inner dance and self-expression Expressive Movement Therapy will explore our unique inner dance and self-expression. Through various movement-based techniques, we will engage deeply with our self-identity, the craft of movement and hence enhance our personal integration. It is through this heightened sense of self, we will become empowered enough to reach out to others. This creative-therapeutic-expressive movement process will suit a wide range of personalities and body types. The workshop will use body preparation exercises, creative movement sequences to music, guided dialogues, dance studies and movement relaxation techniques, to strengthen the body-mind connection and the capacity for effective expression and communication. With their enhanced creativity, problem-solving skills, and renewed capacity for introspection and exploration, participants will emerge equipped for resonant and fruitful daily interactions, as well as the ability to use movement activities & games with other groups of children, adolescents, adults and the elderly. Shamanic Sweatlodge - A purification ceremony to start off the year Sweat lodges are ceremonies of purification and a way to connect humble ourselves from our everyday mind and more deeply to source. In doing so we are able to gain clarity about what really is important and to set our intentions from that place. Forms of these ceremonies have been used by many different native cultures, in many countries and the symbolism, structures and procedures vary but always with an intention of seeking guidance and clarity. The ceremonies I facilitate borrow and connect different symbolism from various traditions but belong to no single tradition, rather they are used as tools to access states of consciousness that are available to all, and deeper than the cultural mind. Classes Belly Dance Classes - Allowing from within There will be 2 Belly Dance classes which will create a choreography piece for students to perform at the end of the festival finale. Learn this exquisite and beautiful art form from the Middle East. Bellydance is renowned as a sensual and empowering dance form. It is an amazing way of connecting with your sacred feminine and inner diva! We will be working on a fun and funky group choreography to perform at the closing show! All are welcome, no experience required. Bollywood Dance Classes - Get ready for a movie experience! Bollywood dance is about storytelling. The songs are from the movies and are there for a particular reason- for example, a celebration song, a seduction song, a love song, a song of sadness. So when you dance it out, you are dancing to the words and mood. Different song s are used at different occasions.. there are tons of wedding songs, which you will hear being played at every Indian wedding. Contemporary - Not only the physical dances but the whole of your being expresses In Silence,, There Is Stillness and Also Rhythm� Everyone has a rhythm� �The Heartbeat��It is The Rhythm of the life. We all carry our own beat, it is always there. Life is a Dance, A dance we dance on our own heartbeat. Listen to the breath. Feel the pulse. Feel the beat. Open our body and open our mind. Allowing the body to move the spirit rise� LISTEN / DANCE/ FEEL. Dance, Dance on it, on The Heartbeat. What are we doing Using Contemporary Dance approach, we will have .. *short excise to listen to the breath/heartbeat/body *Fluid movement warm up *Slow stretching movement warm up *improvisation movement *Contact improvisation *emotional approach dance *Freedom Improvisation * Fun and Beautiful Set Routine. Who is it for For the people who are willing to dance. For the people who are willing to move the body. For the people who are willing to connect with self. For the people to just want to start doing something with the body gently and respectfully. For the people who want to know how to improvise dance and movement. For the people who are willing to listen to the heartbeat and breathing Breath Of Life - Connecting through the Chakras Breath of Life can help you become aware of and experience each of the seven chakras. This meditation is active in nature and uses deep rapid breathing and body movement, accompanied by musical sounds to open and bring awareness to the chakras. As we breathe deeply into each Chakra, it allows us to connect with our body and charge the chakras with energy. This promotes a vertical connection between all the chakras and lets the energy flow more easily up and down the spine. There are many benefits of practicing Breath of Life as it helps us to keep the body moving and the energy flowing. It will enable us to bring silence and vitality into our everyday life. While doing this meditation, one has to be relaxed, remain a witness to whatever is happening, and not judge it. Soul Dance - Carried by the earth and the soul as you touch the sky Since thousands of years, the dance was a connection to the original source, to the source of yourself. I take you on a journey to this source, a journey to your soul, feeling the elements of earth, water, air and fire, feeling different qualities, sometimes slowly and tender, sometimes wild and dynamic, sometimes opening and bordering, always in a safe sacred space. You are invited in deep experience enjoyed by yourself, with a partner and the whole group. You will make the experience going to deep emotions and to get to know you completely new. You will make the experience to feel connected with the universe through yourself and the others. �let yourself be carried by the earth and the soul as you touch the sky.� Events New Year Eve 2019 - Start the year in Celebration We aim to bring 2019 in with a bang! To do so we will have some a Sacred Ceremony and intention setting with Cacao, Spectacular Performances, Superfood & Smoothies bar, late night DJs and a special themed Temple. In the Sacred Cacao Ceremony, there is a chance to re-connect to your heart�s wisdom to set intentions of letting go as the old year passes and also of bringing in new ways of being as we enter into 2019. In the warm space of cacao, you are held and nurtured and will experience a heightened sense of connectedness to everyone else around you, others in your life who are not present and to the sacredness of all that surrounds you. One glass of this is provided as part of the festival with further glasses available at the bar. The drink used in our ceremony is made from 100% raw ceremonial grade cacao. It contains a blend of spices and superfoods and is suitable for vegans. Sacred Cacao Ceremony - Open your heart with this sacred medicine Chocolate as you�ve never experienced it before � as a medicine in a group setting to create a connection in the community and become clearer about what really matters to your heart In the ceremony, there is a chance to re-connect to your heart�s wisdom to set intentions of letting go and also of bringing in new ways of being. In this warm space you are held and nurtured and will experience a heightened sense of connectedness to everyone else around you, others in your life who are not present and to the sacredness of all that surrounds you. What Happens in a Ceremony? The format is very loose allowing for us to tune into what is really alive and respond to that, rather than imposing structures from the mind. Very often it includes: - Meditation - Intention Setting - Dancing - Soft Intimacy Exercises (respecting one�s own boundaries of course!) - Tantra - Resting as a Group Our Drink The drink used in our ceremony is made from 100% raw ceremonial grade cacao. It contains a blend of spices and superfoods and is suitable for vegans. The ceremony itself lasts for around 3 and a half hours but the effects stay around in a more subtle way for a few hours after this and you can tune into the wisdom by reconnecting to a quiet space. Some lethargy and emotional movement may occur later after a ceremony as there are an integration and rest period � this is a good time to allow all old emotions to just pass through like a breeze as deep patterns are released. Nurture and be easy on yourself. Students Performances - Space for you to express yourself During the festival, you will have a chance to take part in classes in various styles and learn a choreography piece from some world class teachers. These will be presented on the final evening as a culmination of the whole festival.

Performances - An evening program to relax and enjoy These are evening shows presented by our talented team of dance professionals that allow you to delight in the varied colors and styles of our team. They will include: Belly Dancing Belly dance is primarily a torso-driven dance, with an emphasis on articulations of the hips. Unlike many Western dance forms, the focus of the dance is on relaxed, natural isolations of the torso muscles, rather than on movements of the limbs through space. Although some of these isolations appear superficially similar to the isolations used in jazz ballet, they are often driven differently and have a different feeling or emphasis, which is usually more subtle and contained. Correct posture and muscle control is as important in belly dance as it is in other fields of dance, and enables a dancer to move the hips freely whilst avoiding lower back injuries. The basic posture used varies slightly between styles (in particular, the knees may be more or less bent, the weight may be held slightly further back or forward, and �resting� arm position may vary), but a kinesiologically correct posture should always be used. Some belly dancers also study Pilates or Alexander technique in order to achieve a healthy and efficient posture. Contemporary Dance Contemporary dance is a popular form of dance which developed during the middle portion of the twentieth century and has since grown to become one of the dominating performance genres for formally trained dancers throughout the world, with particularly strong popularity in the U.S. and Europe. Although originally informed by and borrowing from classical, modern, and jazz styles, it has since come to incorporate elements from many styles of dance,[1] but due to its popularity amongst trained dancers and some overlap in movement type, it is often perceived as being closely related to modern dance, ballet and other classical concert dance styles. In terms of the focus of its technique, contemporary dance tends to utilize both the strong and controlled legwork of ballet and modern dance�s stress on the torso, and also employs contact-release, floor work, fall and recovery, and improvisation characteristic of modern dance.[2] Unpredictable changes in rhythm, speed, and direction are often used, as well. It sometimes also incorporates elements of non-western dance cultures such as elements from African dance including bent knees, or movements from the Japanese contemporary dance Butoh. Bollywood Style The term �Bollywood� comes from the combination of the names of Bombay (now known as Mumbai) and Hollywood. The Bollywood film industry, based in Mumbai, is the largest film industry in the world in terms of ticket sales and the number of films made per year. Bollywood films are mostly musicals with very few movies made without at least one song and dance sequence. The films feature love interests, comedy and action thrills. The plots are often melodramatic and often feature star-crossed lovers, corrupt politicians, twins separated at birth, conniving villains, angry parents, courtesans with hearts of gold, dramatic reversals of fortune, and convenient coincidences. Bhangra Bhangra refers to several types of dance originating from the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.[1] The earliest developed of these was a folk dance conducted by Punjabis in the central northern areas of the region to celebrate the harvest, and whose general practice had ended by the Partition, 1947. In the 1950s, a new folk dance, representative of the state of Punjab and composed of glimpses of men�s Punjabi dance styles, was created and eventually received the title of bhangra. In 1954. first-time bhangra was performed on stage. First developed in India and attaining a rather standardized form by the 1980s, the folkloric bhangra was exported to other countries by Punjabi emigrants. By the 1990s, a still newer style of dance called bhangra was being staged in the Punjabi Diaspora, often characterized by a fusion with Western dance styles and the use of prerecorded audio mixes. Aside from these specific dance genres, Punjabi dancing in general, especially when done to popular bhangra music, is often casually called �bhangra�. Nataraj Lounge - Sing and Dance the night away PLAYING THE THE NATARAJ LOUNGE WILL BE JEROME, NILIMESH AND YOU!

Playback Theatre Workshop,Film,8,"Rajesh P.I of The Actors Collective conducts a Playback Theatre workshop for a Max. of 20 participants. Playback Theatre is an improvisational theatre form that has its roots in Psychodrama. As a theatre form it works as a fantastic foundation for new actors. For experienced actors, it provides an opportunity to extend their range as actors and iron out the creases. More than purely entertainment, this is a powerful form to overcome social anxiety, improve communication skills, enhance creativity, improve self esteem, develop better public speaking skills, develop team building skills, empathy, sensitivity and improved personal well-being...This improvisational form of theatre uses audience real life stories as material for actors to play it back to audiences in real-time without any prior discussion. Playback Theatre honours the sharing of stories in a ritualistic and intimate setting...Playback Theatre has its origins in New York in the early 70's. Today it is a global movement that spans more than 60 countries. In India, Rajesh was among the earliest theatre practitioners to learn this form from Bev Hoskings (Aus) & Mary Good (New Zealand) trainers from the International Playback Theatre Network (IPTN) in 2000. Since then, he has trained under more trainers notable among them are Jonathan Fox (U.S) the founder of Playback Theatre, Jennie Kristel (U.S), Karin Gisler (Switzerland), Joke Rood (Holland), Gerry Orkin (Aus), Brian Tasker (UK) & Christian Faber (Ger). Over the years he has trained hundreds of people in this form. He is presently the India Representative of the International Playback Theatre Network (IPTN) which is the sole body that oversees Playback growth worldwide...The Two day workshop: The workshop focuses on providing a basic introduction to the form through very specialised theatre games. It will help participants open up to their potential, introduce and provide a working knowledge to Playback Theatre. The exercises will be focused at developing the improvisational acting skills of participants. In his 23 years of experience as a theatre trainer, Rajesh credits Playback Theatre as the form which has influenced him the most...Once the workshop is over participants have the opportunity to rehearse regularly with The Actors Collective where most of the learning happens over time. The group is committed to learning and fosters an environment of empathy and compassion. It is a space to share personal stories and learn the tools of the form. The diversity in terms of ages and backgrounds provides a healthy network of people to fall back on. The group meets regularly and perform for the public on the 2nd Saturday at different locations across the city and on the 4th Sunday of every month at Lahe Lahe. The Actors Collective is a community of passionate people who come from diverse backgrounds and age groups, all for the love of Playback Theatre. The group has won the bid to host the International Playback Theatre Conference in India in 2019 where hundreds of Playbackers from around the world will get together and celebrate the magic of Playback Theatre...About the trainer: Rajesh P.I started dabbling in theatre when he was in college in 1993. He co-founded Script Peoples Theatre (SPT) in 1995 along with two others. His group instituted the Theatre-In-Education Dept in Christ University which was active for more than a decade. Rajesh moved on from SPT in 2013 and started his own theatre group - The Actors Collective. The same year he was honoured by Rotary and presented a plaque by the Governor of Karnataka for 'meritorious services as an exemplary theatre teacher'. Rajesh has made a memorable foray into cinema by playing a major role in the Kannada blockbuster 'Last Bus' which was released in 2016 and which won two state awards. In addition he has acted in six other full length feature films in Kannada, Malayalam and one Indie film. He is a much sought after acting coach..Workshop Fees: Rs. 4,600.Dates: 11th and 12th August 2018.* For any queries please call Rajesh on 98450 75825.",

Bad And Beautiful World Film Festival 2018,Film,8,"You must be aware by now of the fact that our new language is films. Hence to internalize the varied aspects of film, from watching films to discussing about it, we do all- and simultaneously we keep shooting films. We jolly well understand that through films we not only capture our real life in the reels but rather in the process keep building ourselves as well. We sharpen our life skill or soft skill. We try to find parity between our viewpoint on gender or rights and the actual reality. A sense of responsibility quite naturally percolates within us as we now wear the cap of director, editor, production controller, distributor or actor. It seems that somewhere someone, remaining invisible, keep changing our stereotypical and orthodox mentality. And it is through this invisible masterminding that there emerges life-cinema like Abhishar, Sakha or Dhop. To be precise, it can be said that we ourselves are writing our own stories...Bad and Beautiful World is a film festival that gives national and international student filmmakers the opportunity to participate in a challenging and fun initiative. They can send in their short films to compete for best film during the BBW Festival. The committee will carefully select the best movies, which will be screened at our festival. There is no specific theme for the films topic. During the festival there will be a jury to select the best film overall. The aim is to make students aware of what other students can achieve through film. The short films offer an opportunity to view the world from a different perspective, based on other cultural backgrounds. The unique part of BBW Short Film Festival is that it is a cultural event that is organized by and for national and international students...Short films are the haiku of cinema. The medium insists that you be rigorous in how much you can speak in the story and in how short a time. It’s a great way to practice your craft. The short film tests the rigour of every medium of cinema. At the moment, Short Film Format is the place to be. Things change from generation to generation. This generation absorbs things faster so they want to express immediately. You have to say a lot in a very short time. In feature films you start telling the story only in the 3rd or 4th reel - first you build up the plot, time is taken to develop characters, there is song and dance and then you come to the actual story. But in the short you just come straight to the point. A short film is a maker’s manner of experiment. It can be very challenging to work in a short format. It has to be hard-hitting, concise and good. What they convey to us within 3-10 minutes, others can take up to three hours. And so like bees to a hive, shorts are attracting amateurs and professionals alike...What is feeding the trend is a combination of the following: emerging platforms, new audiences, and a growing demand for content. Both small and prestigious film festivals are now regularly setting aside time slots to accommodate shorts since they garner full houses. Multiplex chains such as PVR are picking up short films and screening them in theatres and viewers are lining up to pay and watch. Numerous online platforms - Humara Movie, Pocket Films, YouTube, Terribly Tiny Tales, Large Short Films, Hot Star and several others – are luring more and more visitors to their sites offering great content for free or nominal subscriptions..Why do Prayasam Visual Basics keep asking for ‘real’ people and not actors? Non-professionals are better because they don’t act. They don’t protect their ability, and they aren’t confused by what acting should or should not be or look like, they just are. This makes them much more natural on screen than people ‘acting’. Professional actors tend to ‘act’, and by act, I mean ‘consciously pretend’. Now they don’t know that they are, because they can’t see their own performance, but if you look, you can see them ‘acting’, you can see them doing it. You see, trying to be a character, is the most self conscious thing you can possibly do, because you are always aware that you are trying to be other than yourself, and you have to consciously be different, making you instantly unnatural. You see, if you want to act for the screen, acting is the very last thing you need to do. The struggle is in representing the character and their journey, but non-professional actors don’t trouble themselves with all the hokey shenanigans that professionals believe help them perform. They simplify rather than complicate. In the world of film and television, we expect to treat what’s happening as absolutely real, so we crave total authenticity, and the camera is very unkind, it will punish you for faking it. This makes the job of the actor even harder, even the camera hates ‘acting’. So when they cast real people, they don’t get that, they don’t get histrionics, they don’t get ‘my method and motivation’ actors, desperate to prove they are artists. Real people just get on with it, without pretend, without fuss, they just do it...There’s a saying which many of us have heard: ""Love like in the movies."" But sometimes, real life is the best inspiration for film-makers interested in the subject of love. Incredible love stories happen for real in plenty of people’s lives — the kind of romances which no screenwriter could ever dream up. And sometimes, these experiences become the basis for great movies. There is no “best” romantic movie. Something is funny when someone laughs, or romantic when their heart swells, for better or for worse, and we have no right to say why one of these should top another. The secret of the Great Stories is that they have no secrets. The Great Stories are the ones you have heard and want to hear again. The ones you can enter anywhere and inhabit comfortably. They don’t deceive you with thrills and trick endings. They don’t surprise you with the unforeseen. They are as familiar as the house you live in. Or the smell of your lover’s skin. You know how they end, yet you listen as though you don’t. In the way that although you know that one day you will die, you live as though you won’t. In the Great Stories you know who lives, who dies, who finds love, who doesn’t. And yet you want to know again...This year our 5th Bad and Beautiful World short Film Festival boasts of 8 such short-films...Know more at.",

Objective..Especially for children, with photo and video becoming their first playthings, We, Space Time Trains, feel the need to engage them with this medium as a new language or tool of imagination at an age when they pick up a new language the best. With digital technology bringing in a variety of communication mode on one's fingertip through mobile phone and Internet, with imaging technology is at everyone's pocket, possibly replacing a notepad and a pen, motion picture is becoming the global system of communication...Through workshops that combine theoretical understanding, practical exercises, exploration of the medium's history and future possibilities; Space Time Trains has taken a motto to enable children to engage with the medium consciously, thoughtfully and make full use of its potential - from professional cameras to mobile phones, from studio workstations to household PC...2. Topics..We design practical exercises that reflect the evolution of cinema and its expanding possibility. Beginning with observing the formation of real images through lenses, pinhole cameras, and camera-obscura to understand the basic technology behind cameras - followed by exercises to understand light and exposure, then studying the power of image composition in communicating the photographer's observations more precisely. From stills we move to illusion of motion; using early cinema toys and simple animation techniques we see how a series of still images create movement. Then we prepare them to take a single shot in video, understanding the basic unit of Narrative Cinema. From their surroundings they learn to pick up the story they want to tell. Or construct actions from imagination and bring them to life through direction and shot taking. Next, they learn to take a series of shots to expand the possibility of the single shot narrative, and make a short film...Participants will have hands on experience in still photography, basic stop-motion animation, video shooting, narrative construction, and making video sequences to make their own short films. Their skill learning and the capacity building will be rooted in understanding the intrinsic nature of Cinema and enthuse an active participation and appreciation of cinematic art...3.

Lost Perth,Historical,12,"From its settlement in 1829, Perth gradually took shape as a modest town. In the early years, its development suffered from a severe shortage of investment and labour to build anything above modest buildings.Change came slowly, and each round of building was, in general, an improvement of existing living conditions. As the economic situation improved, the early, almost temporary, structures gave way to larger and better buildings. The first gold boom of the 1890s gave Perth the financial impetus to transform the city from a sleepy country town into an elegant and stylish city, with successive mineral booms thereafter contributing to an attitude of �out with old and in with the new�. Taking the losses in chronological order, Richard Offen catalogues the beloved buildings and Perth institutions that time and progress have swept aside.
